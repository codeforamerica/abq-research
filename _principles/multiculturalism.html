<p>The City of Albuquerque is home not only to a vast and colorful landscape but also to a unique and richly textured community that  continues to capture imaginations. Multiculturalism requires that we be conscious of the cultural diversity within the city as we create products and services. It is important that we understand and leverage the diverse cultural perspectives and local capacity already existing within the community.  As University of New Mexico professor laureate and director of the film and digital media program Miguel Gandert told us, “multiculturalism means that various cultures in a society merit equal respect.” Gandert’s words inspire us to use the most inclusive language in our work and align with the already existing community building progress. Most importantly, it will help us frame our concepts and solution in relation to the work already being done within the community.</p>

<p>We believe that being culturally grounded and inclusive will help us identify a diversity of champions with whom we can partner in specific focus areas. In the long term, this can help the city engage with local leaders that might not come through the traditional routes of higher education or politics to get into city hall. In larger part, aligning with the organizational outcome of “skill based hiring in city hall.”</p>

<p>We’ve failed if our work doesn’t take Albuquerque’s cultural particularities into consideration at every step and we haven’t identified leaders and champions from outside the ranks of the traditional echelons of power.  We will also have failed if we fail to identify a cultural taboo and trip up on it without learning from our mistake. This will happen — as none of us are from New Mexico — and part of this principle is to have a contingent response for when it does.</p>

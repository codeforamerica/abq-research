<p>In conjunction, the team is excited to work with leaders in city hall and the community to find new solutions to old problems. We are passionate about doing, not just thinking and will work to always keep our work open and transparent through regularly publishing our work and findings online, holding discussions and co-design session with both community and city partners, and aligning our principles and themes with clear input and validation from experts not only in subject matter but proximity.</p><h1>ALBUQUERQUE FELLOWSHIP</h1>

<p class="sub-headline">What’s the objective?</p>

<p>As New Mexico’s largest city, the City of Albuquerque is working to increase opportunities for economic development and social mobility for all residents. The CfA has partnered with the Albuquerque Mayor’s Office to research and build interventions to the barriers that residents face in accessing critical information, services, and employment opportunities. Code for America fellows will test and develop a technology solution that facilitates upward mobility for Albuquerque residents. The overall goal — as outlined by the city — is to “enhance the upward mobility of residents by focusing on economic development initiatives.”</p>

<p>To help us understand what that means in digestible terms — here are some points from our initial brief:</p>  

<ul>
        <li>Make more people "employable"</li>
        <li>Remove barriers to information about jobs, job opportunities, employer incentives</li>
        <li>Create pathways from family services to skills for employment to access to jobs</li>
        <li>Surface and identify 'soft skills and services' to enable people to look for work (daycare, nice cloths, etc).</li>
</ul>


<p class="sub-headline">How will this affect the City of Albuquerque?</p>

<p>There are two types of defined outcomes, <span class="sub-headline" style="font-weight: bold;">Primary</span> and <span class="sub-headline"  style="font-weight: bold;">Organizational</span>.</p>

<span class="sub-headline" style="font-weight: bold;">Primary Outcomes</span>

<p>The largest is to connect the dots and standardize some of the communications and data being shared between the city and it’s residents around economic development departments, initiatives, and community partners. The city would also like to see us ‘refresh’ some of the technology now used for skills based hiring. Including hiring within city hall. Another stinging objective is to improve access to talent for small businesses moving to or operating out of the metro area.</p>

<span class="sub-headline" style="font-weight: bold;">Organization Outcomes</span>

<p>The first thing we heard from our city partner when we stepped foot in City Hall is to be ‘catalyst for change!’ No kidding, by the brief it states: “make stakeholders see that change is possible and inexpensive.” Another outcome, that’s less ominous is to grow the civic tech community and improve sustainability for new services. Lastly, to scale up data opportunities and allow the city to become “information rich, instead of simply data rich.”</p>

<p>As a team we look to achieve a bold solution to a bold problem — by setting our aims high we can fail gracefully — in a way that builds trust towards the boom and bust tendencies of the work in technological fields. In hopes that our actions will inspire ot

title: A POSITIVE NARRATIVE

<p>Despite having a history of negative representation in the media, residents see an opportunity to positively enhance Albuquerque’s narrative. As one resident put it, “we are not good at telling our own story.” Through conversations with the community it became clear that negative opinions about Albuquerque have found their way into the minds of many residents. Both from large, external sources like The New Yorker and Rolling Stone (who both profiled the city’s police departments in the last year) to small local news sources focusing their attention on anything with dram,  drugs or violence.</p>

<p>There is an opportunity to help grow residents’ confidence in themselves and in Albuquerque as a unique place to live. Our goal is to draw out and amplify the already existing positive narrative. </p>

<p>We will deploy a positive narrative in our work. Meaning that all the elements of our work — from color to fonts, to graphic design and all the way to story, framing, and thesis — will be chosen deliberately with a positive underlying tone. Through doing this we hope our work will support the initiatives that are already successfully operating in this space. </p>

<p>We’ve failed if our work is not aligned with the positive messages that the city is trying to embrace. We’ll work with residents constantly to keep our narratives grounded by the community’s voice.</p>

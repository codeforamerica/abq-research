<p>In this report we have done our best to condense and synthesize our findings from our February government residency. We have been working diligently to define boundaries in which to construct the problem space and create interventions within. As you may have discerned from the objectives above, the scope is fairly large. Therefore, as designers and technologists we believe in working iteratively which requires a good basis of principles and themes as a grounding force in what can otherwise be whimsical, and eventually futile, work without guard rails.</p>

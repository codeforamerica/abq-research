<p>For low-incomes residents, the most challenging issue was the lack of awareness of city services and opportunities. As one Albuquerque resident said after she first visited the New Mexico Workforce Connection Center, “I pulled over over 500 jobs here in Albuquerque alone for nursing. Carpenters, plumbers you name it, it’s right there… you just need to go. I think a lot of people don’t know that’s where they need to go.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is an opportunity to more effectively empower low-income residents with respect to applying for jobs, posturing themselves as viable candidates, creating external mentorship networks, and developing an actionable roadmap to sustainable jobs and success.</p>

<p>For those that are not coming from communities of need there are many concerns centered around a lack of understanding where support structures lie and how to best utilize them, both civic and private. In parallel, there is a large policy shift to invest and create an innovation space (specifically downtown) by the offices of Mayor Berry and Gary Oppedahl.</p>

<p>Within this lense we would like our work to support and align with that policy as much as possible while also helping those that have less and want more, as mentioned above. That includes the possibilities of helping connect communities of need with co-working spaces like Fat Pipe ABQ, helping low-income citizens get specialized training through the CNM STEMuluous centers Deep Dive Coding bootcamp, encouraging recent graduates to attend hackathons and challenges to spin up their own businesses through the WESTT or ABQ ID accelerator program.</p>

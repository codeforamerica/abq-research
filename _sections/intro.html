<p>Code for America is a San Francisco based non-profit that believes government can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century. Code for America works with cities to build open source technology and organize a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use. They do this by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Encouraging and empowering residents to take an active role in their community. </li>
	<li>Facilitating collaboration between government staff and foster forward thinking approaches to solving city problems.</li>
	<li>Supporting civic minded entrepreneurs and startups.</li>
</ul>

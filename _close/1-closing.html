<p>As a team of fellows we have many ambitions for ourselves, for the CfA, and for the city of Albuquerque. Of course the most crucial of these ambitions — the one you’d generally care most about — is for the city. Though, we’d like to share more broadly as the organization has an overarching principle of operating with openness and transparency. That said, the ambitions for the city are outlined in the outcomes section at the beginning so we won’t spend more time reiterating. Instead, we will focus on Code for America’s and our personal outcomes.

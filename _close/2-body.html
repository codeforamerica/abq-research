<p>The largest challenge in doing any type of fellowship work is not competing and aligning with existing efforts. This has a lot to do with our goal of wanting our project to continue to be used and maintained after we leave. The founder of the CfA Jen Pahlka has recently been preaching “Opps not Apps” which to us means we need to be careful that we are not building stuff without awareness. This specifically relates back to our design principles. Lastly, we want to actually help those who need help the most. This is a big statement, we know, but we’ve made a commitment to our team this year that we want to do something that is bold and replicable, something that will affect many residents in Albuquerque now and in the future.

<h1>HOPES</h1>

<p>We are advocating for inclusion and deep impact most, through this year-long process of our teams research and development of a project and also the incubation of a brigade in the city we hope that Albuquerque sees a revitalization of civic participation through modern technological solutions. Fun is also one of our primary hopes. We had so much fun being in the community for the research residency and we were so welcomed. We’re looking forward to continuing to co-design with this vibrant community!</p>

<h1>AMBITION THEMES</h1>

<p>UNIQUE, CHALLENGING, INCLUSIVE, LASTING, FUN</p>

<h1>SHOW, TELL, & TALK</h1>

<p>On April 22rd at FatPipe ABQ from 6-8pm MST we will be presenting our month of meetings with members of the community — very much in line with this report. There will be facilitated conversations about the themes identified above. There will also be a discussion of next steps and how to best continuously involve the community in the continuing creation and engagement process.</p>

<h1>THANK YOU!</h1>

<p>While in Albuquerque we found an incredible amount of hospitality from the residents. We were never questioned in our intentions and were always welcomed into many businesses and homes alike. We are immensely grateful to the individuals who helped us gather these initial findings and will continue to offer our support through teaching, hosting, or facilitating the technologies which we are experts in. The team would simply like to say thank you for the openness and willingness to talk with us and participate in this process over the year of 2015.</p>

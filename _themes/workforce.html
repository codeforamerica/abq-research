<p>Workforce is a broad area of economic development that has many players, ideas, and a legacy of solution focused interventions such as TABE testing and GED preparation. Albuquerque is no exception. There are many organizations doing profound work in this area across the spectrum, from displaced high school students to the underemployed and unemployed, all the way across to micro-businesses and entrepreneurs. </p>

<p>On the end of the spectrum where hardships like displacement and poverty are daily stressors, residents said that the most challenging issue is the lack of awareness of city services and opportunities. As one resident said when we talked to her at the New Mexico Workforce Connection Center, “I pulled over over 500 jobs here in Albuquerque alone for nursing. Carpenters, plumbers you name it, it’s right there… you just need to go. I think a lot of people don’t know that’s where they need to go.” </p>

<p>Other challenges for residents include forming external networks, developing career navigation skills, and having a clear roadmap to jobs with growth potential. While they are ‘soft skills,’ they are tremendously valuable. External networks are those that have multiple points of contact — it has as much to do with access as it does with reputation. It’s an area that most in hardship don’t see as a huge possibility but could be the difference between getting an interview or not. A career roadmap was another need. This would help residents know where they might stand on the path to a certain career.</p>

<p>We see an opportunity to more effectively empower low-income and poor residents  with respect to applying for jobs, posturing themselves as outstanding candidates, creating external networks, and developing an actionable roadmap that provides a clear path to  high-growth industries.</p>

<p>For immigrant business owners,  some of the biggest needs include fostering a direct relationship with the city to know about infrastructure development in their areas, hands-on entrepreneurship training, understanding the steps to scale their enterprise, and mentorship.  Other needs included access to alternative sources of capital, needing assistance with in-house tasks such as branding,  and understanding accounting and tasks. Immigrant business owners share a lot of needs with the hardship spectrum of workforce development but through a very different lens. Whereas the residents in hardship are looking for access and support, the immigrant community is looking for deeper access to information and support through consistent communication.</p>

<p>We see the City’s current efforts to create an innovative and technology focused downtown as a resource for those who are looking to grow their skills and advance to the next stage in their career. As the nation’s workforce becomes more independent either by choice or force, it is crucial that all residents are equipped with the skills to navigate their careers. We’ve taken a particular interest in the independent workforce population as it spans the entire spectrum from contingency workers like those in domestic or seasonal agricultural occupations to boutique workers like yoga instructors and Uber drivers. </p>

<p>As we continue to explore this area, we will focus on what a workforce consists of, how workforces change over time, and how to support residents as it changes. This theme is the heart of economic mobility for any city and we are excited to take a long hard look through our continuation of research and prototypes.</p>

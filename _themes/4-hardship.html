<p>It is often difficult to define economic hardship. A well versed lab technician could lose his job and find himself in hardship. Or a senior in college could have a car accident and drop out. This is actually a problem that Robin Brulé and Shana Runck are working to solve with the Stay @ UNM project. Through a local credit union they’ve set up a service that gives students no-interest loans to finish school. The only thing they have to agree to is a series of financial management workshops and a couple of one-on-one financial counseling sessions. It’s a win for the institution and the student, and as a bonus any delinquency on these loans will never be reported as bad credit.</p>

<p>On the other side of the spectrum of hardship we see a pill that is hard to swallow. 70% of New Mexico is working poor. You’re working poor if you receive at least one social service. The poverty rate in Albuquerque has steadily increased over the past 7 years, affecting youth 18-24 years old and children under 5 years old the most. It’s predicted that almost 1/5th of the residents are living below the poverty line. For children it’s even worse at 29% believed to be living in poverty.</p>

<p>While in Albuquerque we spent a couple of mornings volunteering at The Storehouse. This foodbank has been operating for more than 47 years feeding the working poor and homeless. It’s been around so long it’s created a network of churches who hold specific types of food drives to fulfill its needs. The Storehouse created partnerships with local grocery stores and employs many residents volunteering and working under disability. The Storehouse has served around 50,000 local families with food and clothing.</p>

<p>Throughout our conversations with civic servants and community service providers, the most common ask from the city was increased access to and awareness of social services for low-income resident in Albuquerque. There is a significant need for a centralized and easily updatable repository of these services. The residents also want more access as well as more awareness for what is already happening. We’ll seek to make our project represent the needs of those that need the most in hopes of uplifting their quality of life through providing more opportunity.</p>

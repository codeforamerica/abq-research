<p>The City of Albuquerque is spearheading an initiative to grow a long-lasting technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship community downtown that “connects the dots” between communities and the city. A central concern among residents is connecting the new innovation initiative to the broader Albuquerque community that exists outside of the conventional technology and entrepreneurship world. As one resident put it “I hope that we don’t leave out already marginalized communities as we innovate.”</p>

<p>Much of the problem lies in the fact that different communities are not communicating and thereby lack awareness of one another’s activities. There is a suspicion from the past that things are not being done for the right reasons. Surprisingly, we have found the opposite — everyone we met showed us things that suggested their door was open for conversations and feedback. As we expressed in our principles, we want to engage and generate as much of those conversations as possible.</p>

<p>We hope to engage all types of entrepreneurs working in every corner of the City. Take for example, Kei Tsuzuki and Molly Luethi, two female entrepreneurs who run Kei & Molly Textiles LLC, a South East Heights based printing studio dedicated to creating artisan-quality, hand-printed fabric goods. Kei and Molly are committed to holding community based workshops and hiring refugee woman and equipping them with the important job skills to flourish in the community. They believe that they can help revitalize Albuquerque’s International District while sharing their skills. </p>

<p>Another population we hope to engage are the millennials, the newest generation that is more connected than ever and has more self-sufficiency than any before it. It’s predicted that 16% of millennials are not even looking for work or having given up their search. We’d be willing to predict that a lot of these new workers will probably find ways to work independently. One example is Roxanne Blair who does excellent work in Albuquerque by way of her venture, Creative Start-ups. She works with local residents to help incubate creative businesses and projects. She has worked with a diversity of entrepreneurs, ranging from a young woman who works with Navajo tribes to make jewelry to a physical trainer who designs products to help people with long term fascia pain.</p>

<p>As the City continues to define the downtown innovation district, we see an opportunity to more effectively connect local communities and residents, be they entrepreneurs like Molly and Kei, millennials like Roxanne, immigrants, independent works,  senior citizens, low-income, or involuntarily part-time workers. Our work will look to help create more connecting points and opportunities for all residents.</p>

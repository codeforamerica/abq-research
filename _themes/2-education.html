<p>The City of Albuquerque is constantly working to grow the number of educated and literate residents. According to a recent report written by the New Mexico Voices for Children, New Mexico ranks 46th in the nation in the percentage of community college students who go on to obtain certificate or degrees in a 3-year period or transfer to a 4-year college. Furthermore, only 30% of all participants who start adult education programs complete them and only 8% transition into college or occupational after exiting their program.</p>

<p>Youth Development Incorporated (YDI) has been working for over a decade with students who did not finish high school and youth whose misfortune lead them to juvenile incarceration. YDI helps students complete their GED or post-secondary education, and move into meaningful careers.</p>

<p>Workshops and hands-on instruction are another crucial component of  economic opportunity and development. One example, quietly occupying its new space downtown is the Coding Bootcamp at the CNM STEMulus Center. Starting only in the last few years — John Mierzwa saw an opportunity to train and place coders into newer businesses that were desperately searching for talent. Although they started small, they’ve shown significant success and many of the graduates are involved and committed. The opportunity Mierzwa saw is not hard to justify; throughout the United States coding bootcamps have a 63% placement rate for full-time employment averaging a starting salary of $80,000. Wow! Right!? We think this a fabulous example of just how integral education is in professional development.</p>

<p>We see an opportunity to help residents find well-defined pathways leading to post-secondary and industry recognized credentials in growing industry sectors. We hope to accomplish this by drawing from,  helping advance, and connecting the already strong work of organizations such as Youth Development Inc and the CNM STEMulus Center.</p>
